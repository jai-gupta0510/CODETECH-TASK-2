# Here's a simplified explanation of the Employee Management System database setup and operations:

### 1. *Database and Tables Creation:*

   - *Tables:* Four tables are created within this database:
     - *Departments:* Stores department details like department ID, name, and location.
     - *JobPositions:* Stores job positions with details like position ID, title, and description.
     - *Employees:* Stores employee information, including their name, birth date, hire date, department ID, and job position ID.
     - *Salaries:* Stores salary details for employees, including salary amount and the effective date.

### 2. *Adding Records:*
   - *Departments:* Departments like Engineering, Management, and IT are added with specific locations.
   - *Job Positions:* Job roles like Software Engineer, HR Manager, and Web Developer are added.
   - *Employees:* Employee records are added, linking them to specific departments and job positions.
   - *Salaries:* Salary records for employees are inserted with specific amounts and dates.

### 3. *Fetching Data:*
   - *All Employees with Department and Position:* A query retrieves all employees, displaying their department name and job position.
   - *Salary History for an Employee:* A query shows the salary history for a specific employee.
   - *Employees in a Specific Department:* A query fetches all employees in a particular department.

### 4. *Updating and Deleting Data:*
   - *Updating Employeeâ€™s Department:* You can change an employee's department by updating their department ID.
   - *Deleting a Job Position:* A job position can be deleted if no employees are currently assigned to it.

### 5. *Fetching the Highest Salary:*

This system helps manage and organize employee-related data efficiently, including their roles, salaries, and departmental associations.
